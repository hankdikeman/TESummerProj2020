## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document, which makes it easy to demonstrate outputs of your code in a professional manner. I'm making this so that Pat and Shri can see what this type of document looks like since we will do a lot of our initial coding in this format (with heavy lifting done by supporting R programs).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
